# marathon-heatmap-simulation
Tracking personnel movement patterns for marathon simulations and visualizing crowd density heatmaps
Subfigure 1 simulates a circular track with points moving at varying speeds, representing athletes during the race. Marathon spectators are depicted as gray dots, including stationary crowds along the track's sides and mobile spectators gathering as the race progresses.
Subfigure 2 visualizes the density of people during the marathon race using a heatmap, with colors indicating varying levels of density.
Finally, when all athletes complete the race, the program automatically terminates and provides a notification.

## Files
